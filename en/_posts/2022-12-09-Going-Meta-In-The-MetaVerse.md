Hello world!

I saw a new step in the revolution so I'm writing it down. [I got a new face](https://prisma-ai.com/lensa).

You're what you are seen is the same perspective in the computational world and in the non-computational world. However, the difference is that in the former world we can go beyond of our appearance that is tied to the non-computational world. In reality, ML and traditional computation are merged with the non-computational world, and the definition of "What am I in this world? keeps changing. Rethinking how to be in this world, it is surely more of the state of fusion than ever. The data used to create the new face is the mugshots of the non-computational world, but let us not forget that it was predominantly the gift of the visual arts of collective wisdom.

Visual information is an important part of life, and I felt that this face fits well into my way of being. It is the flip side of the fact that even in the computational world, the individual from non-computational world is still connected. But what's surprising is that the creation of the face took [only 20 minutes and a few dollars](https://prisma-ai.com/lensa). The level of fitness in this ever-changing dynamic of reality and its accessibility is truly astonishing and unprecedented, and today is a day that marked a new step in [the revolution](https://mdaisuke.net/en/2020/01/20/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E5%A7%8B%E5%8B%95/).
