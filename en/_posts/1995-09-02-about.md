Nice to meet you! I'm Daisuke and a freelance engineer based in Tokyo. My main job is backend development and engineering management of web applications.

I majored in physics when I was a student, and learned English as a second language while attending a Japanese university in Japan. Through cross-cultural exchanges, teaching English, and publishing a book on how to learn English, I have gained a wide range of perspectives.

In software development, I believe it is important not only to write clean code that is easy to maintain and modify, but also to cooperate with people from various backgrounds and work as a team to maximize the value we pursue.

Outside of my core business, I also create a wide range of hardware, from robots to bicycles to furniture for daily life. In short, I love making things, regardless of the boundaries between them! I believe it is important to cultivate multiple perspectives in order to create good products.

Please feel free to DM me to <a href="mailto:contact@mdaisuke.net">here</a> for work requests.
