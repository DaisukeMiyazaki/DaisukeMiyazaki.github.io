Generative AI has become capable of telling sophisticated lies indistinguishable from human ones
Precisely because of such an era we must not delegate "understanding" itself to AI

Gathering information interpreting it in our own way and putting it into words
Then connecting disparate knowledge and experiences to form a single thread
This act of "connecting the dots" is the essence of thought
A domain that must never be delegated to others let alone AI

So what should we do

First keep a diary
Record daily events and feelings in your own words as they are
And instead of just writing and forgetting repeatedly look back at past notes
Ideas and records written there may connect with memos from other notes at unexpected moments

By facing your notes and continuously updating them your thoughts will deepen

We must find time in our daily lives to continue these activities
Otherwise we will fall into intellectual stagnation and be unable to move forward
