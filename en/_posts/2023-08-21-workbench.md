Tried DIY! Gifting a Custom-Made Workbench to My Art-Loving Wife

<img src="/assets/images/workbench/front.jpeg" class="image_in_post_sm" onclick="openModalImage(this)">

Hello, everyone! Last month, I took up the challenge of making a unique workbench that can't be found in stores, just for my art-enthusiast wife. I've written down the entire process for you here.

It's wonderful to see my wife enjoying her art, but the clutter in our small room—less than 5 tatami mats in size—is an issue. Storage space is insufficient! Also, the posture while sitting and working is not ideal.

So, I thought that a workbench that allows her to enjoy art while standing could solve these problems. And with that, let the DIY begin!

### Before Building, UX Design

First, I decided the height of the tabletop. I happened to have a height-adjustable desk, so we checked what would be comfortable both when standing and sitting. By roughly observing the centerline of the body, we measured a height that seemed appropriate for when standing.

When sitting down, the line of sight tends to lower.

At this height, her face is still looking down and her neck would be in pain.

<img src="/assets/images/workbench/test3.jpeg" class="image_in_post_sm">
</div>

At this height, it seems to be mostly straight. Even compared to when standing, you can see that it is mostly centered. I found out that a height of around 110 centimeters is good.

### Design

Next, I used 3D modeling for the design, considering overall balance, center of gravity, and gathering my wife's feedback. Key points included:

#### Ample Storage

Art often requires more tools than finished works. <br>
Large storage is essential to avoid clutter.<br>
Added doors for items that can become messy during work.

#### Showcasing Inspiration

Books, magazines, cards, and trinkets are items she wants to display.<br>
We envisioned open storage to keep them in sight.<br>
Having these items always visible aids in finding inspiration.

#### Space

A wider bench is better. I went for one that fills the wall. The tabletop is 50 cm deep, providing just enough space for a laptop.<br>
The front 20 cm of the tabletop can be folded down, making it more compact when not in use.

### Sourcing Materials

Next, I bought wood based on the design. But here's where I hit a snag: the wood was not as wide as I had planned. I decided to adjust the scale of the model instead of wasting materials.

...

And then, after buying it, came the big problem. How do I transport this wood? I don't have a car and it won't fit in a taxi... It's too hot to carry it outside. I was in trouble.

But then, I found out that at the hardware store, they offer same-day delivery service that can be used in-store! I was saved by this same-day delivery service. I paid an additional delivery fee and everything was delivered to my house the next day

### Start Building

Once the wood arrives, all that's left is to build. I'll continue building it just as I imagined. Here's the progress so far...

Since the door did not turn out to be the size or model I had imagined, I had to retrofit it. I went back to the home center, Konan, for shopping, but it was too hot to carry the huge door on our bicycles. It would have been foolish to pay for shipping again...

At that moment, we found out that Konan offers a free rental of a light truck. It was the first time I learned that I could drive it with a regular license and a handle. Thanks to that, I was able to transport it smoothly.

</div>

...

I started building again. When I attached the door, I had more trouble than I expected with attaching the hinges. I referred to [this article](https://magazine.cainz.com/article/81662) for help.

For the finishing touch, I applied a coat of varnish. I made sure to ventilate the room properly even in the hot weather. I wore double masks in the room where there is no air conditioner in the room during the summer....

For finishing, I need measures against falling. It's a big thing, so it's essential. I planned to strengthen the legs in the model, but it was too much work to process... After thinking about it, I found this one piece at the home center and it solved the problem.

Also, I added a back panel to eliminate lateral shaking.

### Completion

Finally, it's done!

<div class="image-container_triple">

  <img src="/assets/images/workbench/front2.jpeg" class="image_in_post_sm" onclick="openModalImage(this)">
  <img src="/assets/images/workbench/front3.jpeg" class="image_in_post_sm" onclick="openModalImage(this)">
</div>

The foldable tabletop measures 180cm x 50cm, providing ample space.

</div>

The posture when standing is almost identical to our measurements, promising a comfortable art-making experience.

</div>

The tabletop also doubles as a door, hiding cables and providing a cleaner look.

<img src="/assets/images/workbench/codes.jpeg" class="image_in_post_sm" onclick="openModalImage(this)">
</div>

So, what do you think? Why not use the resources and services around you to DIY something special as a gift?

Happy Building!
