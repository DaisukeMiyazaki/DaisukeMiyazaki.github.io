excerpt: In an era where generative AI can tell sophisticated lies, we must not delegate the act of thinking and connecting dots in our own words.
---

Generative AI has become capable of telling sophisticated lies indistinguishable from human ones.
Precisely because of such an era we must not delegate "understanding" itself to AI.

Gathering and interpreting information in our own way and putting it into your own words has become ever crucial. Because without it, connecting disparate knowledge and experiences to form a single thread, will be impossible.
This act of "connecting the dots" is the essence of thought: a domain that must never be delegated to others let alone AI.

So what should we do?

One of the easies starting points would be keeping a diary.
Record daily events and feelings in your own words as they are.
And instead of just writing and forgetting, repeatedly look back at past notes, ideas and records. This would allow us to connect with memos from other notes at unexpected moments.

Your thoughts will make progress, by facing your notes and continuously updating them.

I believe we must find time in our daily lives to continue these activities.
Otherwise we will fall into intellectual stagnation and its worst case, be unable to move forward.
