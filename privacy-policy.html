    <h1>Privacy Policy for Walk-v2</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Walk-v2 does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users. All health and step count data remains on your device and is never sent to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>HealthKit Data</h2>
    <p>This app accesses step count data from Apple's HealthKit framework solely to display your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly step counts. This data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remains on your device at all times</li>
        <li>Is never transmitted to external servers</li>
        <li>Is only used for displaying your step count information within the app</li>
        <li>Can be revoked at any time through iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Health</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Voice Memos</h2>
    <p>Voice memos recorded in the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li>Are never transmitted to external servers</li>
        <li>Can be deleted by you at any time</li>
        <li>May be exported to your chosen location (such as iCloud Drive) only when you explicitly choose to do so</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>While the app requests location permissions, no location data is currently collected or stored. This permission is reserved for future workout tracking features.</p>
    
    <h2>Peer-to-Peer Communication</h2>
    <p>The app includes peer-to-peer communication features that allow sharing step count data between nearby devices. This communication:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only occurs when you explicitly enable it</li>
        <li>Uses Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework with encryption</li>
        <li>Only shares step count numbers, no personal information</li>
        <li>Does not involve external servers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since no data is transmitted from your device, your privacy is protected by your device's built-in security features. All app data remains under your control.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the App Store.</p>
