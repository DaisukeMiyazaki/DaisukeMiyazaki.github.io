In modern development, I've witnessed many "overkills". It's fine to build sites using modern frameworks when a large amount of dynamic data processing with multiple channels of authentication etc. But still, there are "overkills" such as loading large JavaScript files just to display banners or toggle buttons. Also as product, there are other type of "overkills" where the reader's experience is "polluted" by excessive advertisements.

It is entirely "possible" to achieve responsive, lightweight, and high-performance behavior using simple HTML and CSS. It is entirely possible to keep your product clean. In addition, creating a place to your liking can be said to be one of the true pleasures of being an engineer.
